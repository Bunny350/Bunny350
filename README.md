**Oitswilliam Pang** and the Open Source. Sometimes makes products that already exists, but other times don't.

Oitswilliam Pang (real name: Pang William) is a hobbyist and a tinkerer and sometimes a tech nerd<!-- buster --> who is interested in making new products and "beefing-up" some of other's features. He also likes to debunk fake or unreal contents.

The current repository he ranges includes:
* Original designs (i.e. BabyDrone),
* Mods for already existing products made by someone else,
* Website designs and source codes made with [Silex](https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex),
* Minecraft Add-ons source codes.

Anyways anyone can come here and contribute to make something that is free from obstacles by resolving them. Just know how to fork and every of my projects will be constantly improved by the communities.

My account was created in August 24, 2015 for tryouts, among stupid things, which made [madness robot](https://github.com/Bunny350/madness-robot) empty repository. It was then reused in November 2021 because of the open-source hardware.
